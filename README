# 3D particulate flow simulation code. #
---

## Before build: ##
---
1. Copy the ves3d project files to the install location and make an
    environment variable pointing to that location:
```
#!shell
    $ cd ves3d-cxx
    $ export VES3D_DIR=`pwd`
```

1. In makefile.in.files directory, make a file for the machine you're
installing VES3D. You can copy one of the existing machine files, for
example
```
#!shell
    $ cd makefile.in.files
    $ cp makefile.octane makefile.`hostname -s`
```
You can alternatively use one of the existing host files by passing
the VES3D_PLATFORM variable to make.

1. In the platform specific makefile you created in the previous step,
    set the correct include paths for libraries

1. If the makefile corresponding to your choice of compiler does
    not exist, you also need to write that makefile (with the correct
    extension)

 1. Optionally add makefile.<hostname> to hg for future reference

## Building: ##
---
 1. cd to VES3D_DIR and
```
#!shell

    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make check
```

 1. If the code compiles fine and tests pass, run
```
#!shell

    $ make install
```
## Misc: ##
---
1. Code-specific compiler options are: VERBOSE, PROFILING, VES3D_TESTING, VES3D_USE_GPU, VES3D_USE_PVFMM
1. If you want the GPU code compiled set "VES3D_USE_GPU=yes" in makefile.<hostname>
1. Fully functional revisions of code are tagged by vYY.ID (YY is year and ID is an integer)

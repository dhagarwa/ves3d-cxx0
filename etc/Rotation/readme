The results profile certain functions and report timings, flops, and
flop rates. 

In the output, "size" characterized the number of frequencies used in
spherical harmonics. The higher, the larger the matrices. We're
interested in obtaining good flop rates for all values of "size" in
the experiment.

See RotationDoc.pdf for a brief explanation of the kernel.
